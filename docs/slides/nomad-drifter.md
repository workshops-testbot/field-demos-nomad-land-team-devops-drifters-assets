# HashiCups - Locked Into Containers

.center[![:scale 70%](images/HashiCupsContainers.png)]
.smaller[
  Team discovered HashiCups, a set of containers enabling us to sell coffee.  However...


* HashiCups is 100% Container Based
* Need Support for Online Payment
* Management need us to expand across regions

???
Currently we are using an application to sell a lifesaving drug - caffeine.  The application is called 'HashiCups' and we found it on Github somewhere. Unfortunately we didn't find any working cloud access keys, the developers must have been using Vault.

The challenge we are having is that although we saved a ton of money finding this application, it's all container based, and we aren't container specialists.  If we could just use the application as is, that wouldn't be a problem, but we need to add the ability to process payments online.

Also, management has pushed us for world domination, so we'll have to get the application working in another region without having to manage multiple databases and synchronization.  Oh my oh my what is an engineer to do?

  Through Nomad, we are able to foster an infrastructure that enables more freedom and flexibility...
  * Increase Utilization Efficencies
  * Reduce Operational Overhead AND accelerate time to market
  * Run multiple types of workloads seamlessly - no need to containerize
  * Safely expand and update with blue-green deployments

Through Nomad, we are able to foster an infrastructure that enables more freedom and flexibility.  At the surface this may appear to just make the lives of the engineers better, but there is so much more.  The overall business can benefit greatly through...
* More efficient hardware utilization through Nomad Jobs
* Reduction in operational overhead AND accelerate time to market - no longer need to convert to containers just for the sake of container
* Safely switch over to new or upgraded components using canary deployments, within or across regions

Core benefits to the business
Increase Hardware utilization - not really in this demo
Reduce Operational Overhead - same process containers or not
Accelerate time to market - no need to containerize
Stateful workloads for Postgres
Deploy secure applications - not really in this demo
